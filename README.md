# High Dimensional Stratification of Election Polling Data for Predicting Election Surprises with Regression

Polling for elections is often wrong -- but can it be wrong in predictable ways? Here we explore the presence of a hidden high-dimensional structure in polling measurements
to build a more accurate system of aggregating polling data for regression. We hope to illuminate the presence of non-linear, high-parameter relationships between different
features present in polling measurements.

*Figure 1: An example of a feature in polling data that predicts error. States that have a population that is disproportionately
White exhibit predictable polling error that benefits the Republican candidate. The observed heteroskedasticity in extreme
positive x values indicates the interaction of other features in the data that also contribute to error not due to random noise.*
